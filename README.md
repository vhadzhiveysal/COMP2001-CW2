Introduction
The Trail Application Micro-Service exposes a set of API endpoints that allow clients (e.g., web or mobile applications) to retrieve hiking trail data stored in a SQL Server database. The micro-service provides an endpoint to fetch trail information and return it in a JSON format.

Features:
Access to detailed trail information, including name, length, estimated time, and elevation gain.
RESTful architecture that allows for easy integration with other components of the Trail Application.
Simple error handling and response structures.

Technologies
This micro-service is built using the following technologies:

Python: The primary programming language for building the micro-service.

Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the REST API.

SQL Server: The database used to store trail data.

PyODBC: A Python library for connecting to SQL Server databases.

Postman: API platform software

Open app.py using Python, copy the url in cmd to postman. Then in app.py, add the parameters for each function listed and match the api method as well to run each command.
